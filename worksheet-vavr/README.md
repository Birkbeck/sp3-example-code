# Worksheet on the Java functional programming library [`vavr`](https://docs.vavr.io/)

1. Define a `Vavr` List containing ten integers (1 to 10) and filter out all even numbers. 

2. Create a `Vavr` `Option` containing a `String` value `"hello"` and use pattern matching to return the `String` value if it exists or a default value `"world"` if `None`.

3. Given a `List` of `Users` with a `name` and `age` attribute, write a function to find the first user older than twenty using `Vavr`'s `find` function. 

4. Write a `Vavr` function that takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD) using recursion.

5. Implement a function to check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backwards as forward) using `Vavr`'s collections and functions. 

6. Simulate a simple e-commerce scenario. Define a `Product` class with attributes like `name` and `price`. Create a `List` of products and then write `Vavr` code to find the product with the highest price. 

7. Write a `Vavr` `Try` block to handle a potential exception when reading a file.

8. Given a `List` of transactions with an `amount` attribute, use `Vavr` to group transactions by currency and calculate the total amount per currency. 

9. Parallelise a loop that iterates through a `List` of numbers and squares each number. Leverage `Vavr`'s *parallel collections* to achieve this. 

10. Write a `Vavr` function that validates a `String` to ensure it contains at least eight characters and at least one uppercase letter.
